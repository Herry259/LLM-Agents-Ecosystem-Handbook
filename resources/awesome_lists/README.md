# Other Curated Lists and Resources

The ecosystem around large language models is rich and constantly evolving.  In
addition to the application skeletons and tutorials found in this repository,
there are several other curated lists that collect research papers, tools and
frameworks.  This section highlights those lists and clarifies their focus so
that users can explore complementary resources.

## Major LLM curated lists

- **Awesome‑LLM** (≈ 25 k ★) – a curated list of milestone papers and
  frameworks for training and deploying LLMs.  It includes courses,
  tutorials and links to publicly available checkpoints and APIs【353244841090028†L254-L258】.
- **Awesome AI Tools** (≈ 3.1 k ★) – a collection of generative‑AI and
  LLM tools covering text, code, image, video, marketing and chatbots【725796767296810†L255-L266】.
- **Awesome Production LLM** (≈ 0.5 k ★) – a list of open‑source projects
  for taking LLMs into production, including data preprocessing,
  training/finetuning, evaluation frameworks, serving/inference and
  monitoring【577320243189096†L247-L267】.
- **Awesome LLM Agents** (≈ 1.1 k ★) – focuses on frameworks and agent
  development tools such as CrewAI, LangChain, AutoGen and Llama Index;
  features described include role‑based agents, multi‑agent collaboration
  and memory systems【759911502420073†L257-L331】.
- **Awesome Local LLM** (≈ 0.25 k ★) – catalogs platforms, tools and
  practices that help run LLMs locally.  It spans inference platforms,
  engines, user interfaces, models and tutorials【411141313589789†L249-L276】.
- **Awesome LLMOps** (≈ 5.3 k ★) – a curated list of operations tools for
  LLMs, covering serving, security, data management, training and
  deployment workflows【244354101175071†L253-L307】.
- **Awesome LLM Interpretability** (≈ 1.4 k ★) – collects tools, papers,
  articles and communities focused on understanding and explaining
  LLMs【209448133516183†L249-L252】.

Each of these lists serves a specific purpose—whether it is keeping track of
research papers, cataloguing general AI tools, curating production pipelines,
enumerating agent frameworks, enabling local inference, supporting operations
or studying interpretability.  By contrast, this repository emphasises
application skeletons, end‑to‑end tutorials, multi‑agent teams and complete
apps, giving developers a practical starting point for building their own
LLM‑powered solutions.
