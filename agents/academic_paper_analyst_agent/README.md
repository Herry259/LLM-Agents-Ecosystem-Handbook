# Academic Paper Analyst Agent

This skeleton defines an **Academic Paper Analyst Agent**.  Its goal is to ingest scholarly articles, extract the research questions, methods and results, and generate structured summaries.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To extend this agent, consider using `PyPDF2` for text extraction and an LLM to synthesise the findings.  You can also leverage citation APIs for metadata.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Extract and parse academic papers from PDF or arXiv sources.
- Identify sections such as abstract, introduction, methods and conclusion.
- Use an LLM to summarise the paper and generate a list of key takeaways.
