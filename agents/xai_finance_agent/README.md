# xAI Finance Agent

The **xAI Finance Agent** skeleton is designed to analyse financial data and
generate insights, predictions or reports.  It is intended to be
explainable (“xAI”) by providing reasoning or feature importance with
its outputs.  The current version simply prints a placeholder.

## Setup

You may wish to install packages like `pandas`, `numpy` and `matplotlib`
when extending this agent:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Load financial time series (e.g., stock prices) and compute indicators.
- Train interpretable models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees)
  and visualise feature importance.
- Generate PDF or HTML reports summarising the findings.
