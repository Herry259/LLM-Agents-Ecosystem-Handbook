# AI Medical Imaging Agent

This is a skeleton for an **AI Medical Imaging Agent**.  In a complete implementation,
this agent would load medical images (e.g., Xâ€‘rays, MRIs), apply computer
vision models to detect anomalies and output diagnostic insights.  The
current skeleton simply informs you where to insert your own logic.

## Setup

When extending this agent you may want to install libraries such as
`opencv-python` for image processing or `torch`/`keras` for deep learning:

```bash
pip install opencv-python pillow
pip install torch torchvision  # optional for neural networks
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Load DICOM or JPEG images from a directory.
- Use a pretrained model (e.g., U-Net, ResNet) to detect features.
- Visualise results with bounding boxes or heatmaps.
