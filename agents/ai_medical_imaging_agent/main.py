AI Medical Imaging Agent (Skeleton)
-----------------------------------

This script is a placeholder for analysing medical images.  Currently it
prints a message and exits.  To build a full agent, load images from
disk, preprocess them and run them through a computer vision model of
your choice.  You can then postâ€‘process the output and present a report.
