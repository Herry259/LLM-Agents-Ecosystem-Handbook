"""
Breakup Recovery Agent
----------------------

This agent simulates a supportive friend who listens to your feelings and
offers encouragement.  It uses simple keyword matching to detect
common themes (sadness, anger, guilt) and responds with empathetic
messages.  You can expand this logic or integrate a sentiment analysis
library for richer interactions.
