# Chatbot Analytics Agent

This skeleton provides a foundation for analysing chatbot interactions.
It can be extended to extract metrics such as response times, sentiment
distribution or conversation lengths.

## Objective

Offer a structure for understanding how users interact with chatbots and
identifying areas for improvement.  It may also highlight frequently
asked questions or pain points.

## Setup

Install PythonÂ 3.8+ and any libraries required for log parsing or
visualisation.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to read chat logs,
compute metrics and output dashboards or reports.
