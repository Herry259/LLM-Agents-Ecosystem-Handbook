# AI Competitor Intelligence Agent Team

This skeleton sets up a **Competitor Intelligence Agent Team**.  Such a team
would research competitors, analyse market positioning and synthesise
findings.  The current version prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

No dependencies are required for the placeholder.  When implementing
this team, you might integrate with web scraping tools, research APIs
and a coordinator framework.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Define roles such as researcher, analyst and summariser.
- Assign each agent a subtask (e.g., collecting data, benchmarking or
  writing reports).
- Combine results into a single competitive intelligence document.
