# Trend Analysis Agent

This skeleton introduces a **Trend Analysis Agent**.  Its aim is to monitor social media or news feeds, identify emerging trends and report on their significance.  The current version prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To expand this agent, you could use APIs such as Twitter, Reddit or Google Trends (subject to terms of service) and natural language processing libraries like `gensim` or `scikit-learn` for topic modelling.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Collect data from social media or news sources.
- Cluster posts using topic modelling or embeddings to detect trending topics.
- Summarise and visualise the results for stakeholders.
