# Energy Consumption Optimizer Agent

This skeleton is intended for agents that analyse energy usage patterns
and recommend strategies to reduce consumption or costs.  It can be
applied to households, data centres or industrial facilities.

## Objective

Provide a foundation for modelling power usage and suggesting
optimisation techniques such as load shifting, appliance scheduling or
efficiency upgrades.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries required for reading energy data (e.g.
`pandas`) or performing timeâ€‘series analysis.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder in `main.py` with code that ingests energy
consumption logs, performs analytics and outputs actionable insights.
