# Multi‑Agent Teams

This directory is a pointer to the multi‑agent team examples in the parent `agents/` folder.  Rather than storing duplicate code, it lists the available team templates and their purposes.  Multi‑agent teams demonstrate how multiple specialised agents can collaborate to accomplish complex tasks.

| Team | Description |
|---|---|
| [`ai_competitor_intelligence_agent_team`](../ai_competitor_intelligence_agent_team) | Researches competitors, analyses market positioning and synthesises findings. |
| [`ai_finance_agent_team`](../ai_finance_agent_team) | Coordinates budgeting, forecasting and reporting tasks across multiple agents. |
| [`ai_teaching_agent_team`](../ai_teaching_agent_team) | Develops lesson plans, delivers content and assesses learner progress. |
| [`mixture_of_agents`](../mixture_of_agents) | Demonstrates coordinating diverse agent types for a single task. |
| [`multi_agent_team`](../multi_agent_team) | General template for building and orchestrating teams of agents. |

Each team example contains its own `README.md` and `main.py` file with instructions on how to run and extend the team.  To dive deeper into multi‑agent design patterns, see the articles referenced in [`docs/best_practices.md`](../../docs/best_practices.md).
