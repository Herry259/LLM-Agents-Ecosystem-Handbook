# Compliance Audit Agent

This skeleton outlines a **Compliance Audit Agent**.  It would assess an organisationâ€™s processes and documentation to ensure adherence to regulatory standards.  Unlike the Compliance Checker Agent, which focuses on individual documents, this agent audits entire workflows.  The current stub prints a placeholder.

## Setup

To expand this agent, you may need to define audit criteria and gather evidence from various systems via APIs or logs.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Identify the regulations and standards applicable to your domain.
- Collect evidence from process logs, documentation and system outputs.
- Generate audit reports highlighting compliance status and gaps.
