# IoT Device Monitoring Agent

This skeleton is designed for agents that supervise IoT devices and
collect telemetry.  It can be extended to detect anomalies, alert
operators or summarise performance metrics.

## Objective

Provide a baseline for building monitoring systems that ingest sensor
data, identify issues and report on device health.  It is applicable to
smart homes, industrial IoT or fleet management.

## Setup

Install PythonÂ 3.8+ and libraries for data streaming or MQTT
communication as needed.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to connect to IoT
devices, process their telemetry and generate dashboards or alerts.
