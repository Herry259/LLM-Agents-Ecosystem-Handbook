# Chatbot Training Data Generator Agent

This skeleton lays the foundation for a **Chatbot Training Data Generator Agent**.  Its purpose is to create synthetic dialogue datasets for training conversational models.  The current implementation prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To create training data, you might use promptâ€‘based generation techniques or templates combined with an LLM.  Libraries such as `datasets` and `jsonlines` can help structure the output.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Define conversation scenarios and generate example dialogues using an LLM.
- Introduce variations in style, tone and content to improve model robustness.
- Save the generated conversations in formats compatible with your training pipeline.
