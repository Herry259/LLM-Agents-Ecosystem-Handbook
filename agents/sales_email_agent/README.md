# Sales Email Agent

This skeleton defines a **Sales Email Agent**.  It would create personalised outreach emails tailored to prospects, drawing on public information and sales best practices.  The current implementation prints a placeholder.

## Setup

To build a full agent, you could integrate with CRM systems and use LLMs for drafting emails.  Tools like `yagmail` may assist with sending messages.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Ingest prospect data (e.g. names, company, pain points) from a CRM.
- Generate customised emails using prompt templates and an LLM.
- Track responses and iterate on email copy to improve conversion rates.
