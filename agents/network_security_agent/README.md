# Network Security Agent

This skeleton provides a starting point for building agents that monitor
network logs and detect security anomalies.  It can be extended to
identify suspicious patterns, flag potential intrusions or summarise
security reports.

## Objective

Offer a basic template for ingesting system logs and running rule‑based or
machine‑learning‑based anomaly detection.  The agent can then report
findings in a human‑readable format.

## Setup

Install Python and any log parsing libraries, such as `pandas` or
`scapy`, depending on your data sources.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder logic in `main.py` with code to load network logs,
apply detection algorithms and output alerts.  You can integrate with SIEM
tools or dashboards for real‑time monitoring.
