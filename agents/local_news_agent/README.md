# Local News Agent

This skeleton outlines a **Local News Agent** that aggregates and summarises
news articles from local or regional sources.  A complete agent might
fetch RSS feeds, parse article content and generate concise summaries.  At
present, this example prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To fetch and parse news feeds you can use libraries like
[`feedparser`](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser) and
[`newspaper3k`](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper):

```bash
pip install feedparser newspaper3k
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Fetch RSS feeds from your favourite news sources and extract article links.
- Use `newspaper3k` to download and summarise the articles.
- Optionally integrate with a summarisation model to improve the quality of the summaries.
