# Climate Change Insight Agent

This skeleton is aimed at analysing and summarising climate‑related data
and research.  Use it to produce concise insights from scientific papers,
datasets or news articles on climate change.

## Objective

Provide a basic structure for building agents that digest environmental
information and surface key metrics or trends.  The agent can help
communicate complex findings to a wider audience.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any libraries required for parsing documents or
datasets (e.g. `numpy`, `pandas`).

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your setup:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Update `main.py` to fetch climate data, read research articles and
generate summaries or visualisations.  Consider leveraging LLMs to
translate technical terminology into lay language.
