# Remote Learning Assistant Agent

This skeleton helps build agents that support students in remote or
selfâ€‘paced learning environments.  It can be extended to schedule
study sessions, track progress and provide personalised reminders.

## Objective

Provide a template for designing study assistants that help learners
manage their time and stay engaged.  It may integrate with calendars,
learning management systems or messaging platforms.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries required for scheduling or messaging.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to set up study
schedules, track assignments and send reminders.  You might also
incorporate spaced repetition algorithms to optimise retention.
