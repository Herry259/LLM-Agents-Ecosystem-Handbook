# Chatbot Personality Agent

This agent skeleton helps design and manage conversational personas for
chatbots.  It can be extended to generate consistent tone, style and
behavior across dialogues.

## Objective

Provide a template for defining chatbot personalities and enforcing
linguistic rules or guidelines.  Use it to ensure that your bot stays on
brand and responds in a coherent, human‑like manner.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any libraries needed for prompt management or
fine‑tuning, such as `openai` or `transformers`.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to define persona
templates, manage prompt injections and maintain conversation history.
You can integrate this agent with chat platforms to deploy consistent
personalities across channels.
