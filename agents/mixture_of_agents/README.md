# Mixture of Agents

This example is a **Mixture of Agents** skeleton.  In a full implementation,
multiple specialised agents (e.g., translator, summariser, classifier)
would collaborate on a task, passing messages and partial results between
them.  The current files provide a placeholder to guide your design.

## Setup

No external dependencies are required to run the placeholder.  If you
decide to implement multiple agents, you may want to use frameworks such
as `crewAI` or `AutoGen` for orchestration.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Define individual agent classes for each subtask (e.g., translation,
  summarisation).
- Implement a coordinator that assigns work, collects results and manages
  the workflow.
- Persist intermediate results in a shared memory or database.
