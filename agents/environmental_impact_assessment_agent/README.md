# Environmental Impact Assessment Agent

This skeleton helps you build agents that evaluate the environmental
impact of projects or products.  It can be extended to analyse
emissions, energy usage and sustainability metrics.

## Objective

Provide a framework for modelling the footprint of various activities
and generating assessment reports.  The agent can highlight areas for
improvement and compliance with standards.

## Setup

Install PythonÂ 3.8+ and any libraries relevant to data analysis or
environmental modelling.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to gather
emissions data, apply calculations and generate sustainability reports.
