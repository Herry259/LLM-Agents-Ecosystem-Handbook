# Personalisation Agent

This skeleton creates a **Personalisation Agent**.  It would tailor content, recommendations or interfaces to individual users based on their behaviour and preferences.  The current version prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

Building a personalisation agent may involve user profiling, clustering and recommendation algorithms.  Respect privacy and data protection regulations when handling user data.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Collect and analyse user interactions across your product.
- Develop profiles or segments and adjust content accordingly.
- Continuously learn from feedback to improve personalisation over time.
