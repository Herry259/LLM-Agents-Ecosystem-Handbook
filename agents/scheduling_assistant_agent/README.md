# Scheduling Assistant Agent

This skeleton defines a **Scheduling Assistant Agent**.  It would coordinate meetings, find mutually available times and send invitations.  The current implementation prints a placeholder.

## Setup

To implement scheduling, integrate with calendar APIs (e.g. Google Calendar, Outlook).  Consider using natural language parsing for interpreting user requests.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Connect to usersâ€™ calendars and fetch availability.
- Parse meeting requests expressed in natural language.
- Suggest optimal meeting times and send calendar invites.
