# Production Pipeline Agent

This skeleton outlines how to orchestrate a **production pipeline** for
large language model applications.  It stitches together data ingestion,
pre‑processing, model inference and post‑processing into a cohesive flow.

## Purpose

While many examples show isolated calls to APIs, deploying an LLM agent
requires handling data formats, batching, error handling and integration
with external services.  This agent provides a high‑level template for
building such pipelines.

## Setup

1. Identify the data sources your application will consume (e.g. CSV files,
   message queues, databases) and implement ingestion code.
2. Decide on a processing framework: plain Python scripts, asynchronous
   tasks, or an orchestrator like `Prefect`, `Airflow` or `Dagster`.
3. Install any libraries required for your pipeline.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to see where each stage of the pipeline would
fit:

```bash
cd agents/production_pipeline_agent
python main.py
```

## Extending

In `main.py` you can define functions or classes for each pipeline stage:
data extraction, transformation, model inference (batch or streaming) and
result storage.  Integrate retries, rate limiting and logging to make
your agent robust for production use cases.
