# Supply Chain Optimizer Agent

This agent skeleton is designed for applications in logistics and supply
chain management.  It can be extended to analyse inventory levels,
forecast demand and suggest optimal reorder points.

## Objective

Provide a framework for modelling supply chain scenarios and optimizing
operations.  Use it to simulate different ordering strategies, plan
delivery routes or predict stockouts.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any relevant data science libraries such as
`pandas` or `numpy`.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to confirm the agent is set up:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with algorithms for
inventory optimisation, demand forecasting or network flow analysis.
Consider integrating with ERP systems to retrieve real‑time data.
