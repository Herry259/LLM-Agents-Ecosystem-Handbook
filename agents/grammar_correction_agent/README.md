# Grammar Correction Agent

This skeleton defines a **Grammar Correction Agent**.  It would accept user‑written text and return a corrected version with improved grammar, spelling and punctuation.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

You can use grammar correction models such as `gpt‑3.5‑turbo`, `gpt‑4` or open‑source alternatives like `gramformer`.  Install with `pip install gramformer` if you opt for the latter.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Take user input text from the command line or a file.
- Send the text to a grammar correction model and receive the corrected version.
- Provide explanations of the corrections to aid learning.
