# Financial Statement Analysis Agent

This skeleton presents a **Financial Statement Analysis Agent**.  It would interpret corporate financial statements (income statements, balance sheets, cash flow statements) and produce summaries or ratio analysis.  The current implementation prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To expand this agent, use `pandas` for numeric analysis and consider LLMs for generating narrative explanations.  You may also pull data from financial APIs.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Load financial statements in CSV, Excel or PDF format.
- Calculate key ratios (e.g. profit margins, liquidity ratios) and year‑over‑year changes.
- Create narrative reports explaining the company’s financial health.
