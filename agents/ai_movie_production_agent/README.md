# AI Movie Production Agent

This skeleton is for an **AI Movie Production Agent**, intended to assist
with tasks like script development, casting suggestions and project
scheduling.  Currently it prints a placeholder.

## Setup

No dependencies are required for the placeholder.  A full agent could
use NLP models to draft scenes, or integrate with IMDb APIs to search
for talent.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Collect storyline ideas and generate a script outline.
- Search databases for actors that fit character descriptions.
- Create a production timeline and budget estimate.
