# Research Synthesizer Agent

This skeleton defines a **Research Synthesizer Agent**.  Its purpose is to collect information from multiple sources, summarise the findings and generate a coherent report.  This aligns with the growing need to turn unstructured data into business intelligence【51538871972903†L124-L134】 and synthesise research findings from many sources【51538871972903†L127-L142】.  The current version simply prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To implement retrieval‑augmented generation, you might use `langchain`, `llama_index`, or `chromadb` for vector storage.  Install via pip:

```bash
pip install langchain chromadb
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Implement a pipeline that loads documents from local files, web APIs or databases and indexes them in a vector store.
- Use an embedding model (e.g. SentenceTransformers) to vectorise the documents and retrieve relevant passages based on user queries.
- Summarise or synthesise the retrieved information using an LLM and include citations to the original sources.
