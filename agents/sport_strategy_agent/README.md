# Sport Strategy Agent

This skeleton provides a base for agents that analyse sports data and
suggest strategies.  It can be applied to games like football,
basketball or esports, depending on available statistics.

## Objective

Offer a template for modelling game scenarios, evaluating player
performance and recommending tactics.  This is intended for educational
purposes and coaching support.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries needed for data analysis and
visualisation (e.g. `pandas`, `matplotlib`).

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to ingest match
statistics, compute metrics and generate strategic recommendations.
