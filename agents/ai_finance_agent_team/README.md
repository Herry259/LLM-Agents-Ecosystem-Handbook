# AI Finance Agent Team

This skeleton sets up an **AI Finance Agent Team** for tasks like budgeting,
forecasting and reporting.  It currently prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

No dependencies are required for the placeholder.  For a real
implementation you might use `pandas`, `numpy` and possibly a database
backend.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Assign roles such as data collector, analyst and reporter.
- Connect to financial systems to retrieve up‑to‑date metrics.
- Automate report generation and dissemination.
