# E‑Learning Content Generator Agent

This skeleton helps educators create customised e‑learning materials.  It
can generate lesson outlines, quizzes and summary notes based on a given
topic.

## Objective

Provide a template for developing tools that automatically generate
educational content.  Use it to prototype course modules, interactive
assessments or study guides.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries required for content generation, such as
`openai` or `langchain`.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to input syllabus
topics, call language models and format the resulting content.  You might
integrate this agent with learning management systems for deployment.
