# Interpretability Demo Agent

This skeleton provides a starting point for exploring **interpretability**
techniques on top of language models.  Understanding why a model makes a
prediction is essential for debugging, trust and compliance.

## Purpose

Interpreting model outputs can reveal biases, uncover spurious correlations
and build trust with end users.  This agent is meant to illustrate how to
hook up interpretability libraries such as **Transformers‑Interpret** or
**Captum** to visualise token importances, attention weights or feature
attributions.

## Setup

1. Install the necessary packages:

   ```bash
   pip install transformers transformers‑interpret
   ```

2. Ensure you have a compatible model checkpoint downloaded (e.g. a BERT or
   GPT‑2 model).

## Usage

Run the placeholder agent to see a demonstration of interpretability:

```bash
cd agents/interpretability_demo_agent
python main.py
```

## Extending

In `main.py` you can load a pre‑trained model and use interpretability
tooling to generate saliency maps or token attribution plots.  For
example, with `transformers‑interpret` you can analyse which parts of the
input contribute most to a classification or generation task.  Integrate
these insights into your agent’s workflow to improve transparency.
