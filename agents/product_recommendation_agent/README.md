# Product Recommendation Agent

This skeleton introduces a **Product Recommendation Agent**.  It would suggest products or services to users based on their preferences, purchase history or browsing behaviour.  The current implementation prints a placeholder.

## Setup

To build a recommendation system, you might use collaborative filtering or content‑based approaches with libraries like `surprise` or `implicit`.  An LLM can enhance explanations.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Collect user interaction data and build a preference model.
- Generate recommendations using machine learning algorithms or rule‑based logic.
- Explain why a recommendation was made and adjust based on feedback.
