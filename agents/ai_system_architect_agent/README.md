# AI System Architect Agent

The **AI System Architect Agent** skeleton is meant to draft highâ€‘level
software or infrastructure designs from user requirements.  It currently
prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

No dependencies are needed for the placeholder.  For full
functionality, you might integrate modelling tools or diagram
generators.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Ask users for system requirements and constraints.
- Use pattern libraries and best practices to generate architecture
  diagrams.
- Output diagrams in formats like PlantUML or Mermaid.
