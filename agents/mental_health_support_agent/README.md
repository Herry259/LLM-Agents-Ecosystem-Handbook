# Mental Health Support Agent

This skeleton offers a base for building supportive agents that provide
coping strategies, mindfulness prompts or empathetic responses.  It is
designed for mental health awareness and should not replace professional
counselling.

## Objective

Provide a framework for delivering compassionate guidance and resources
to users experiencing stress, anxiety or other mental health concerns.

## Setup

Install PythonÂ 3.8+ and any libraries required for text generation or
sentiment analysis.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to generate
supportive messages and suggest resources.  Always include
disclaimers about seeking professional help for serious issues.
