# Gemini Multimodal Agent Demo

This skeleton provides a starting point for a **multimodal agent demo** inspired
by Gemini’s capabilities.  A multimodal agent can accept both text and
images as input and produce combined analyses or outputs.  The current
files simply print a message indicating where to implement multimodal
logic.

## Setup

For image processing you may need `Pillow`, and for advanced models you
could use frameworks like `transformers` with multimodal models once
available:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py --text "Describe this image" --image_path path/to/photo.jpg
```

At present, the script ignores arguments and prints a placeholder message.

## Extending

- Load the image file, extract features using a CNN and combine with text
  using a transformer model.
- Use a pre‑trained multimodal model (e.g., CLIP or BLIP) to produce
  captions or answer questions about the image.
- Integrate with a GUI or web frontend for interactive demos.
