# Expense Report Agent

This skeleton outlines an **Expense Report Agent**.  It would parse receipts or invoices, categorise expenses and summarise spending.  The current version prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To implement this agent, you may use OCR libraries like `pytesseract` for scanning receipts and `pandas` for aggregating data.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Extract data from receipts (date, vendor, amount) using OCR.
- Categorise expenses and generate monthly or yearly reports.
- Integrate with accounting software for reconciliation.
