# AI Meeting Agent

This skeleton is for an **AI Meeting Agent** that summarises meeting
transcripts and extracts action items.  The current version prints a
placeholder.

## Setup

You may want to use libraries like [`whisper`](https://github.com/openai/whisper) for
speech‑to‑text or transcript analysis when implementing this agent.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Ingest audio or text transcripts of meetings.
- Use NLP techniques to summarise discussions and detect action items.
- Send summaries via email or integrate with calendar software.
