# LLMOps Monitoring Agent

This skeleton illustrates how to integrate basic **monitoring** and
evaluation into your LLM agents.  Operationalising LLM applications
requires more than inference – you need to track performance, detect
drift and log interactions for auditing and improvement.

## Purpose

The **LLMOps Monitoring Agent** demonstrates how to record prompts and
responses, measure quality metrics and emit logs that can be consumed by
observability tools.  While full‑fledged LLMOps platforms exist, this
example shows how to implement lightweight monitoring directly in your
agent code.

## Setup

1. Install any dependencies for logging or evaluation, e.g. `pip install
   openai`, `pip install promptfoo`.  You can extend this with RAGAs
   or DeepEval later.

2. Configure an external logging service or simply log to a local file.

## Usage

Run the placeholder agent to see how monitoring hooks might look:

```bash
cd agents/llmops_monitoring_agent
python main.py
```

## Extending

In `main.py` you can wrap your LLM calls with functions that record the
prompt, the response and any metadata (timestamps, latency).  Compute
basic metrics such as token lengths, approximate perplexity or
classification accuracy, and send these to a dashboard or file.  This
skeleton provides a foundation for integrating more advanced
observability tools over time.
