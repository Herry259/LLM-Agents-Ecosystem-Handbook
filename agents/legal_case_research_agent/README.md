# Legal Case Research Agent

This agent skeleton is designed for legal professionals seeking to
streamline case law research.  It can be extended to search court
databases, extract precedents and summarise key points.

## Objective

Provide a structure for building legal research tools that ingest
queries, retrieve relevant cases and summarise rulings or arguments.
It does not offer legal advice and should be used by qualified
professionals.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any libraries needed for document retrieval or
NLP.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to confirm your environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with integrations to legal
databases, search APIs and summarisation techniques.  Ensure that
citations are accurate and that the agent’s output is reviewed by
licensed attorneys.
