# Customer Support Agent

This skeleton defines a **Customer Support Agent**.  Its role would be to handle customer queries, provide answers from a knowledge base and route issues to human agents when necessary.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To build a complete support agent, you might use a retrievalâ€‘augmented pipeline to search FAQs and product manuals.  Consider integrating with chat frameworks such as `rasa` or `langchain`.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Load a knowledge base (e.g. FAQ documents) and implement retrieval of relevant answers.
- Use an LLM to formulate responses and detect when to hand off to a human.
- Add logging and analytics to monitor user satisfaction and agent performance.
