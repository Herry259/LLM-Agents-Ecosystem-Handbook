# Data Visualization Agent

This skeleton serves as a starting point for building agents that transform raw data into visual insights.  It is ideal for prototyping dashboards or generating charts from CSV files using tools like Matplotlib or Plotly.

## Objective

Provide a basic structure for parsing datasets and creating visualizations such as bar charts, line graphs or scatter plots.  The agent does not include any proprietary code and is intended to be extended with your own data processing and plotting logic.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have PythonÂ 3.8+ installed.
2. (Optional) Install visualization libraries of your choice, e.g.:

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib seaborn plotly
   ```

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your environment.  Modify `main.py` to load a dataset and generate charts.

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder function in `main.py` with logic to read data (e.g. using `pandas`), create plots and optionally save them to files.  You can integrate this agent into larger workflows that perform exploratory data analysis or produce automated reports.
