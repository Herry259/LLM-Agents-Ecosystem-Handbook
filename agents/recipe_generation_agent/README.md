# Recipe Generation Agent

This skeleton provides a foundation for creating agents that suggest
recipes based on available ingredients or dietary preferences.  It can be
used to generate meal plans or cooking instructions.

## Objective

Offer a starting point for building culinary assistants that turn lists
of ingredients into creative, step‑by‑step recipes.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries you may need for language generation or
recipe databases.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder in `main.py` with code that accepts ingredients,
consults recipe sources or uses LLMs to generate instructions and
nutritional information.
