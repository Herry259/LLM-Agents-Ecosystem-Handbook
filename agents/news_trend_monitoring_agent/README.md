# News Trend Monitoring Agent

This skeleton is built for agents that track news and social media to
identify emerging trends.  It can be extended to gather articles,
cluster topics and report on popular narratives.

## Objective

Provide a template for building monitoring tools that digest news feeds
and social channels to highlight trending subjects or sentiment shifts.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries required for web scraping, RSS parsing
or sentiment analysis.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to collect news
articles, apply clustering algorithms and generate summaries or alerts
when new trends emerge.
