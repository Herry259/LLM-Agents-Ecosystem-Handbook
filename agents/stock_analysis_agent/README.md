# Stock Analysis Agent

The Stock Analysis Agent skeleton provides a starting point for analysing
financial markets.  It can ingest historical price data, compute
indicators and summarise trends or anomalies.

## Objective

Create a framework for building applications that monitor stocks, generate
simple signals and produce narrative summaries.  It is intended for
educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.

## Setup

Install Python and relevant libraries such as `pandas` and `matplotlib`.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder logic in `main.py` with code to fetch stock data
from an API (e.g. Yahoo Finance), compute moving averages or other
technical indicators and output charts or summaries.
