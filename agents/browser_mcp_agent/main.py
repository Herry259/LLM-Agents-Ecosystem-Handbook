"""Browser MCP Agent

This script demonstrates how to send basic commands to a browser via a Model
Context Protocol (MCP) server.  The MCP server is assumed to expose
WebSocket or HTTP endpoints that accept JSONâ€‘encoded commands and return
observations.  Replace the placeholder connection and command handling with
your actual MCP implementation.
