# Interview Question Generator Agent

This skeleton outlines an **Interview Question Generator Agent**.  It would create relevant interview questions based on job descriptions and candidate profiles.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To build this agent, you can use job description parsing and an LLM to generate behavioural and technical questions.  Make sure to consider diversity and inclusion in question design.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Parse job descriptions to extract required skills and competencies.
- Generate tailored interview questions using prompt templates and an LLM.
- Allow HR to select or edit questions before sending them to candidates.
