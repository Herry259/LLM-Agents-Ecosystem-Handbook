# Creative Art Generator Agent

This skeleton is aimed at generating visual art or images using
generative models.  It can be extended to create abstract artwork,
illustrations or textures.

## Objective

Provide a base for experimenting with image generation models such as
Stable Diffusion, DALL·E or GANs.  The agent can accept prompts and
produce corresponding artwork.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and your chosen image generation library.  Ensure you
have sufficient compute resources to run the model.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with calls to a generative
model of your choice.  Integrate prompt handling and output saving as
needed.
