# AI Consultant Agent

This skeleton forms the basis for an **AI Consultant Agent**.  A fully
fledged version might provide strategic advice within a specific
industry (e.g., marketing, technology).  The current implementation
prints a placeholder message only.

## Setup

No special dependencies are needed to run the placeholder.  Depending
on your domain, you might connect to market research APIs or your own
datasets when extending the agent.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Implement an interface to gather client requirements.
- Query domainâ€‘specific knowledge bases or use LLMs to generate advice.
- Present recommendations in a clear and actionable format.
