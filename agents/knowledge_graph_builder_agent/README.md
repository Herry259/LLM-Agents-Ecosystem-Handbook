# Knowledge Graph Builder Agent

This agent skeleton helps you construct knowledge graphs from text
corpora or structured data.  It provides a foundation for extracting
entities and relationships and converting them into a graph representation.

## Objective

Provide a minimal framework for transforming unstructured information into
a linked data structure.  Use it to build domain‑specific knowledge
bases or semantic networks.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and libraries such as `spacy`, `rdflib` or
`networkx` for entity recognition and graph construction.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to confirm the agent is installed:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to extract
entities using an NLP model, define relationships and build a graph
structure.  You may serialize the output to formats like RDF or
graph databases.
