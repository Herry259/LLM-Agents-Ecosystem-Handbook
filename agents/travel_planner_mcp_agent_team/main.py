"""Travel Planner MCP Agent Team

This script creates a basic structure for a multi‑agent travel planner.
It defines placeholder agents for planning, booking and communication.
Each agent could communicate via messages and call external services via
MCP commands.  Replace the placeholders with actual implementations.
