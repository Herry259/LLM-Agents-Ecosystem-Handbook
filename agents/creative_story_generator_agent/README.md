# Creative Story Generator Agent

This skeleton presents a **Creative Story Generator Agent**.  It would produce short stories or narratives based on prompts or themes, demonstrating the creative capabilities of LLMs.  The current implementation prints a placeholder.

## Setup

You can build this agent using any text‑generation model.  Consider adding style controls (e.g. genre, tone) to give users more control over the output.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Accept prompts or themes from the user.
- Generate a story using an LLM and optionally enforce certain structures (e.g. three‑act structure).
- Provide settings for genre, length and tone.
