# Bug Triage Agent

This skeleton presents a **Bug Triage Agent**.  It would categorise and prioritise bug reports from issue trackers, assign them to the appropriate teams and suggest possible fixes.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

Implementing a bug triage agent may involve natural language processing to understand bug descriptions and a rules engine or ML model to prioritise severity.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Ingest issues from platforms like GitHub or Jira via their APIs.
- Classify the severity and category of each bug report.
- Recommend potential assignees or duplicate detection and propose next steps.
