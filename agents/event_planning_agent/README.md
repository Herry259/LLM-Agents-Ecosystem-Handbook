# Event Planning Agent

This skeleton provides a starting point for agents that help organise
events.  It can be extended to schedule venues, coordinate vendors and
create timelines.

## Objective

Offer a framework for automating common event planning tasks such as
collecting requirements, generating itineraries and sending reminders.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any third‑party libraries you wish to use for
calendar integration or email notifications.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to interact with
calendar APIs, manage to‑do lists and coordinate with participants.
