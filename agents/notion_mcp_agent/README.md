# Notion MCP Agent

This skeleton demonstrates how to integrate Notion with an agent via the
Model Context Protocol (MCP).  It enables your agent to create, update
and query pages and databases in Notion using MCP actions.

## Features

- Connects to a Notion workspace through the Notion API using an MCP
  wrapper.
- Performs CRUD operations on pages and databases.
- Provides hooks for an LLM to generate or summarise content before
  storing it in Notion.

## Setup

```bash
pip install notion_client aiohttp
```

You will also need a Notion integration token with appropriate
permissions.  Refer to Notionâ€™s API documentation for details.

## Usage

Execute the agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script contains stubs for connecting to the MCP server and
performing Notion operations.  Fill in the TODOs in `main.py` to implement
your use case.
