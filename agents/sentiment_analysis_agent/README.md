# Sentiment Analysis Agent

This skeleton defines a **Sentiment Analysis Agent**.  Its purpose is to ingest text (e.g. customer reviews, social media posts) and assess the overall sentiment (positive, negative or neutral).  In a complete implementation you might use pre‑trained sentiment classifiers from libraries like [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) or `nltk`.  The current skeleton simply prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To add sentiment analysis capabilities, install `transformers` and `torch`:

```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

Alternatively, for lighter weight models you can use `textblob` or `nltk`.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Load a pre‑trained sentiment model (e.g. `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`) using `transformers` and run inference on input text.
- Wrap the model inference in an agent loop that accepts user input from the console or a file and returns sentiment scores.
- Expand the analysis to include emotion detection or aspect‑based sentiment for more granular insights.
