# Digital Marketing Strategy Agent

This skeleton is aimed at generating and evaluating digital marketing
strategies.  It can analyse audience data, recommend channels and
produce campaign briefs.

## Objective

Provide a minimal framework for marketing teams to prototype AI‑driven
strategy generation.  The agent might summarise market research,
segment audiences or outline content plans.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any analytics libraries you intend to use (e.g.
`pandas` or `scikit-learn`).

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with modules that pull data from
marketing platforms, perform audience segmentation and generate strategy
documents.  You might also integrate with generative models to write
campaign copy.
