# Fraud Detection Agent

This skeleton provides a starting point for agents that detect fraudulent
transactions or activities.  It can be extended to flag suspicious
behaviour in financial datasets or user actions.

## Objective

Offer a template for building anomaly detection models tailored to
identifying fraud.  Use it to combine ruleâ€‘based logic with machine
learning techniques.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries used for statistical analysis or
machine learning, such as `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder in `main.py` with code that loads transactional
data, trains anomaly detectors and outputs alerts or scores.
