# Risk Assessment Agent

This skeleton provides a foundation for a **Risk Assessment Agent**.  It would evaluate potential risks (e.g. financial, operational, security) using quantitative models and expert rules.  The current stub prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

Expanding this agent may involve statistics libraries (`scipy`, `numpy`) and domain knowledge.  LLMs can assist in generating plainâ€‘language summaries of risk factors.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Define risk factors and scoring criteria relevant to your domain.
- Aggregate data from multiple sources and calculate risk scores.
- Present recommendations to mitigate identified risks.
