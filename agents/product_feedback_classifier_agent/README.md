# Product Feedback Classifier Agent

The Product Feedback Classifier Agent skeleton categorises customer
reviews and feedback into meaningful labels such as feature requests,
bugs, praise or complaints.  It can help product teams prioritise
improvements.

## Objective

Provide a baseline for building tools that automatically classify
qualitative feedback.  The agent can be trained on existing labelled
comments or fine‑tuned on domain‑specific data.

## Setup

Install Python and any NLP libraries you require (e.g. `scikit-learn`,
`transformers`).

## Usage

Execute the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to load reviews,
vectorise them and feed them into a classifier or LLM.  You may also
connect this agent to customer support platforms to process new
feedback in real time.
