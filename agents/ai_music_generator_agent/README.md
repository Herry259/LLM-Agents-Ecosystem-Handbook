# AI Music Generator Agent

This skeleton demonstrates how you might build an **AI Music Generator Agent**.  The
idea is to programmatically compose music or generate MIDI files.  The
provided files do not generate actual music yet—use them as a scaffold
for your own creative experiments.

## Setup

To generate music programmatically you can use libraries like
[music21](https://web.mit.edu/music21/) or [magenta](https://github.com/magenta/magenta):

```bash
pip install music21
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The current script simply prints a placeholder message.  When extended, it
could create a melody using random notes or a simple algorithm and save it
to a MIDI file.

## Extending

- Use `music21` to construct chords and melodies and write them to MIDI.
- Explore `magenta` for deep‑learning models that can generate music.
- Add a web interface allowing users to select genre or instruments.
