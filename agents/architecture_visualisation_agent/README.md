# Architecture Visualisation Agent

This skeleton aids in converting textual descriptions of systems or
buildings into diagrams.  It can be extended to generate UML charts,
block diagrams or architectural sketches.

## Objective

Provide a framework for parsing system descriptions and producing
visual representations.  This agent can be used for software design
documentation or conceptualising physical spaces.

## Setup

Install Python and any libraries for diagram generation (e.g. `graphviz`
or `matplotlib`).

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with logic to parse input
specifications and output diagrams.  You might integrate with
diagramming tools or LLMs to interpret freeâ€‘form text.
