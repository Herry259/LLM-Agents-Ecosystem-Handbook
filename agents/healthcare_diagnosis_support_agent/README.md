# Healthcare Diagnosis Support Agent

This skeleton offers a base for developing decision‑support agents in
healthcare.  It can assist clinicians by summarising patient symptoms and
suggesting possible diagnoses based on guidelines or research.

## Objective

Provide a template for building tools that synthesise patient information
and deliver differential diagnosis suggestions.  It is **not** a
replacement for professional medical advice and should always involve
clinical oversight.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any healthcare‑specific libraries you plan to use.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder in `main.py` with code that ingests patient data
and consults clinical guidelines or research databases.  Ensure that
outputs include appropriate warnings about the need for professional
interpretation.
