# Compliance Checker Agent

This skeleton provides a starting point for a **Compliance Checker Agent**.  In practice, such an agent would evaluate documents or processes against regulatory requirements (e.g. GDPR, HIPAA, financial regulations).  The current version simply prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

To extend this agent, you may incorporate rule‑based systems or LLM prompts that encode relevant regulations.  For parsing documents, install `pdfplumber` or `pandas` as needed.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Parse documents and extract relevant sections for compliance analysis.
- Compare extracted text against a library of regulatory rules and flag potential non‑compliance.
- Generate human‑readable reports summarising the findings.
