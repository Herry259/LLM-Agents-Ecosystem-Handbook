"""
AI Blog to Podcast Agent (Skeleton)
-----------------------------------

This script serves as a placeholder for converting blog posts into audio
podcasts.  At present, it simply prints a message describing where your
implementation should go.  You can extend this by fetching blog content,
summarising it if necessary and using a text‑to‑speech library to generate
an MP3 file.
