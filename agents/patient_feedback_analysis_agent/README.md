# Patient Feedback Analysis Agent

This skeleton is aimed at healthcare providers seeking to understand
patient feedback.  It can be extended to ingest survey responses or
reviews and summarise common themes.

## Objective

Offer a framework for analysing qualitative feedback and extracting
sentiment, topics or trends.  The agent can highlight areas for
improvement and track changes over time.

## Setup

Install Python and libraries like `nltk` or `transformers` for text
processing.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Modify `main.py` to read patient comments, perform sentiment analysis
and summarise recurring issues.  Ensure that any personally identifiable
information is anonymised.
