# HR Onboarding Agent

The HR Onboarding Agent skeleton automates parts of the employee onboarding
process.  It can generate welcome emails, collect necessary paperwork and
schedule introductory meetings.

## Objective

Provide a basic template for building agents that assist HR teams in
onboarding new hires.  Use it to automate document collection, FAQ
responses and orientation reminders.

## Setup

Install PythonÂ 3.8+ and any libraries you plan to use for form handling or
email delivery.

## Usage

Run the placeholder script to verify your environment:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder logic in `main.py` with code that interfaces with HR
systems (e.g. HRIS or Google Workspace).  You might use this agent to send
welcome packets, check task completion and generate progress reports.
