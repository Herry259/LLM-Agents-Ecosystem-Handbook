# AI Teaching Agent Team

This skeleton sets up an **AI Teaching Agent Team**.  A complete version could
create lesson plans, deliver content and assess learner progress using
multiple cooperating agents.  Currently, it prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

No dependencies are needed for the placeholder.  For a full
implementation you might integrate with educational content sources and
assessment tools.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Define roles such as curriculum planner, instructor and evaluator.
- Pull learning materials from open educational resources.
- Generate quizzes and adapt content based on learner performance.
