# Document Processing Agent

This skeleton forms the basis for a **Document Processing Agent**.  In a full implementation, this agent would accept scanned documents or PDFs, perform optical character recognition (OCR) to extract text and then analyse or summarise the content.  The current version simply prints a placeholder message.

## Setup

When extending this agent, you might use libraries such as [`pytesseract`](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/) for OCR and [`pdfplumber`](https://pypi.org/project/pdfplumber/) for parsing PDF files.  Install them via pip:

```bash
pip install pytesseract pdfplumber
```

You will also need the Tesseract OCR engine installed on your system.  See the `pytesseract` documentation for installation instructions.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

- Implement a function that takes the path to a PDF or image and returns extracted text using OCR.
- Add text preprocessing (e.g., removing headers, footers) and summarisation using an LLM or `sumy`.
- Consider exporting the results to a structured format such as JSON or CSV for downstream analysis.
