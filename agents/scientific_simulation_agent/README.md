# Scientific Simulation Agent

This skeleton is for agents that run or interpret scientific simulations.
It can be extended to configure models, execute computational experiments
and summarise results.

## Objective

Provide a base for automating simulation workflows, from parameter
selection to post‑processing.  It’s useful in fields like physics,
engineering or computational biology.

## Setup

Install Python 3.8+ and any simulation libraries required for your
domain (e.g. `numpy`, `scipy` or domain‑specific packages).

## Usage

Run the placeholder script:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Extending

Replace the placeholder code in `main.py` with calls to simulation
functions, result analysis and reporting.  You might integrate with
visualisation tools to present outcomes.
