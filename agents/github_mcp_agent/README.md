# GitHub MCP Agent

This skeleton sets up an agent that interacts with GitHub repositories via
the Model Context Protocol (MCP).  It can clone repositories, read files,
create branches and commit changes, all while complying with the MCPâ€™s
authentication and auditing mechanisms.

## Capabilities

- Clone or fetch a repository to a local workspace.
- Read and write files, create commits and push changes.
- Integrate with an LLM to generate summaries or propose code edits.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install gitpython aiohttp
   ```

2. Configure your MCP server or GitHub App credentials for API access.

## Usage

Run the agent via:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script contains placeholders for connecting to the MCP server and
performing repository actions.  Extend `main.py` to handle your specific
workflow.
