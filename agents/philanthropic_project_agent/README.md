initiatives.  It can be extended to track donations, evaluate project
impact and generate reports for stakeholders.

beneficiaries informed and ensuring transparency.  The agent can help
organise tasks and measure outcomes.

## Setup

reporting.

donations, evaluate impact metrics and generate dashboards or reports.
