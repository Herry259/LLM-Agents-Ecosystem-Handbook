# Customer Support Voice Agent

This skeleton shows how to build a voice‑enabled customer support agent
that can answer frequently asked questions, log issues and route calls to
human operators.  Combining speech recognition, an LLM and optional
retrieval mechanisms, it provides a natural and efficient support
experience.

## Capabilities

- **Automatic speech recognition (ASR):**  Captures user queries via
  microphone or telephone and converts them to text.
- **Natural language understanding:**  Uses an LLM to interpret the
  customer’s intent and provide appropriate responses.
- **Issue logging:**  Records unresolved issues in a CRM or ticketing
  system for follow‑up.
- **Escalation:**  Hands over the conversation to a human agent when it
  exceeds the bot’s capabilities.

## Setup

```bash
pip install speechrecognition pyttsx3
```

## Usage

Run the agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will simulate a customer support call and print placeholder
messages.  Extend `main.py` to integrate with real ASR, LLM and backend
services.

## Next steps

- Connect to a knowledge base or retrieval system to provide
  context‑aware answers.
- Implement conversation memory for multi‑turn dialogues.
- Add language detection and translation for multilingual support.
