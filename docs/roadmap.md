# Project Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements for the curated LLM apps repository.  Maintaining a transparent roadmap helps
contributors understand where the project is heading and encourages community involvement.

## Short‑term goals

* **Add more interactive examples**: Continue to build out the `web_apps` and `notebooks` directories with user‑friendly demos
  that showcase the power of agent frameworks.  Upcoming ideas include a visual RAG demonstrator and a voice‑enabled chatbot.
* **Improve packaging and distribution**: Provide Dockerfiles or Conda environments for selected examples, making it easier for
  users to get started without manual dependency management.
* **Expand documentation**: Add more tutorials and an FAQ section in the documentation to answer common questions about agent
  selection, evaluation, and deployment.

## Medium‑term goals

* **Integrate continuous evaluation**: Incorporate automated benchmarking of example agents using the evaluation frameworks
  described in `evaluation_frameworks/README.md` to provide objective performance metrics.
* **Develop a plugin system**: Design a lightweight plugin interface so that new agents or tools can register themselves and be
  discovered automatically by other components.
* **Create educational content**: Develop video tutorials, blog posts and presentations to help non‑technical audiences
  understand the concepts behind LLM agents.  This aligns with best practices for promoting open source projects【806548062083687†L539-L551】.

## Long‑term vision

The ultimate goal is to make this repository a go‑to hub for building, evaluating and deploying intelligent agents.  We envision
collaborations with academic institutions and open source communities to curate high‑quality examples and establish best
practices for safe and responsible use of large language models.
