# Best Practices for Building & Promoting LLM Applications

This document collects lessons from experienced maintainers on how to develop and share open‑source projects successfully.  It blends general software craftsmanship with advice specific to Large Language Model (LLM) applications.

## Promote your work

Don’t be shy about sharing your project once it’s public.  Post about it on social media, submit it to sites like Hacker News, Reddit and Product Hunt, and reach out to podcasts or meetups【806548062083687†L501-L509】.  Keep promoting as you improve the project; people appreciate tools that solve real problems, so highlight the value you provide【806548062083687†L509-L513】.

## Focus on the problem, not the buzzwords

When presenting your project, explain *why* someone should use it and what problem it solves.  Avoid overloading your messaging with technical jargon【806548062083687†L519-L527】.  Potential users care about the benefits, not the implementation details.

## Write comprehensive documentation

Clear, up‑to‑date documentation is essential for adoption.  Provide quick starts, tutorials and screencasts to help users get started【806548062083687†L539-L551】.  Remember that people learn in different ways – some prefer text, others video – so offer multiple formats.

## Be responsive to your community

Responding to issues and pull requests promptly encourages engagement and conveys that the project is active【806548062083687†L553-L566】.  Valuing contributors’ time and feedback helps build a supportive community.

## Onboard contributors

Make it easy for newcomers to contribute by providing contribution guidelines and code of conduct files.  Use labels like “help wanted” and “good first issue” to signal where assistance is needed【806548062083687†L573-L577】.  Encourage non‑code contributions such as documentation, testing and design – every contribution counts.
