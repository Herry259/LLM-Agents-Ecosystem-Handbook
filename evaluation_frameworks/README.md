# LLM Evaluation Frameworks

Evaluating Large Language Model (LLM) applications is essential for ensuring quality, safety and reliability.  A number of open‑source frameworks have emerged to help developers test prompts, measure model outputs and monitor performance.  Below is a curated selection of notable evaluation tools, along with a brief summary of their strengths.  Star counts are approximate as of July 2025.

| Framework | Key Features | Stars* | Sources |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Promptfoo** – [github](https://github.com/PromptOps/promptfoo) | Lightweight toolkit for prompt testing and A/B evaluation.  Supports YAML/CLI configuration and LLM‑as‑a‑judge scoring, enabling quick iterations and red‑team checks【716183580503338†L71-L83】. | ~8.3 k | Comet blog |
| **DeepEval** – [github](https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval) | Python evaluation framework described as “Pytest for LLMs.”  Provides a unit‑test‑like interface and built‑in metrics for assessing correctness and relevance【716183580503338†L86-L90】. | ~10.6 k | Comet blog |
| **MLflow LLM Evaluate** – [github](https://github.com/mlflow/mlflow) | Extension to MLflow that adds evaluation of question‑answering and RAG pipelines.  Integrates with existing MLflow experiments and pipelines【716183580503338†L93-L98】. | ~21.9 k | Comet blog |
| **RAGAs** – [github](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) | Suite for evaluating retrieval‑augmented generation using metrics such as faithfulness, contextual relevance and precision【716183580503338†L100-L107】. | ~10.6 k | Comet blog |
| **Deepchecks (LLM)** – [github](https://github.com/deepchecks/deepchecks) | Originally for ML validation, now includes LLM evaluation modules.  Provides rich visualization dashboards to inspect model outputs and detect anomalies【716183580503338†L109-L115】. | ~3.9 k | Comet blog |

## Why Evaluation Matters

As LLM applications become more complex, robust evaluation is critical.  Tools like these help teams:

- **Identify weaknesses** in prompts or retrieval strategies (e.g. low faithfulness or relevance scores)
- **Benchmark alternative models** or agent configurations
- **Monitor production systems** for hallucinations, bias or toxicity
- **Iterate quickly** by automating unit tests for LLMs and RAG pipelines

Choose a framework that fits your workflow and environment.  For example, Promptfoo and DeepEval provide minimal setup for developers, while Langfuse and Phoenix offer end‑to‑end observability across the full stack.
