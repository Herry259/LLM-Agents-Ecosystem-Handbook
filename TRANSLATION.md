# Translation & Localization Guide

This document explains how to contribute translations of the documentation and examples into other languages.

## Why translate?

Providing documentation in multiple languages lowers the barrier to entry for developers around the world and fosters a more inclusive community. While English remains the primary language of this project, we encourage the community to contribute translations.

## How to contribute

1. Choose a document to translate (e.g. `README.md`, `docs/beginners_guide.md`).
2. Create a new file under a languageâ€‘specific folder. For example, translations of `README.md` into Arabic could live in `docs/README.ar.md` and into Spanish in `docs/README.es.md`.
3. Preserve the markdown structure and code blocks, translating only the prose.
4. Add a note at the top of the translated file indicating the language and the fact that it may not be up to date with the English original.
5. Submit a pull request with your translation. Feel free to open an issue first to coordinate efforts.

## Keeping translations up to date

The documentation evolves over time. If you contribute a translation, please consider subscribing to repository updates or watching relevant files so you can update your translation when the English version changes. We rely on community help to keep translations current.
