# Design Resources

This folder contains visual resources and diagrams that illustrate the high‑level architecture of agent systems.  Visual aids help
explain complex concepts to non‑technical audiences and make the project more engaging.  You can use these diagrams in
presentations or documentation to convey how different components interact.

An abstract diagram depicting a modular agent architecture, with components for data ingestion, processing, memory, agent core and
user interface.  The vibrant colours and futuristic style are intended to capture attention and make the project approachable.

If you create additional diagrams, please add a description here and ensure that the images do not contain real logos or
proprietary content.
